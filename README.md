# Welcome to Remix!

- [Remix Docs](https://remix.run/docs)

## Development

You will be running two processes during development:

- The Miniflare server (miniflare is a local environment for Cloudflare Workers)
- The Remix development server

```sh
# in one tab, start the remix dev server
$ npm run dev
```

Open up [http://127.0.0.1:8787](http://127.0.0.1:8787) and you should be ready to go!

This branch uses *faunadb*. Once it's setup, put the secret using `wrangler secret put FAUNA_SECRET`, and the same in the `.env` file too as `FAUNA_SECRET=xxxxx`

## Deployment

Use [wrangler](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/cli-wrangler) to build and deploy your application to Cloudflare Workers. If you don't have it yet, follow [the installation guide](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/cli-wrangler/install-update) to get it setup. Be sure to [authenticate the CLI](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/cli-wrangler/authentication) as well.

If you don't already have an account, then [create a cloudflare account here](https://dash.cloudflare.com/sign-up) and after verifying your email address with Cloudflare, go to your dashboard and set up your free custom Cloudflare Workers subdomain.

Once that's done, you should be able to deploy your app:

```sh
npm run deploy
```
